# GBC Algorithm 

# Graph Based Clustering Method ( GBC ) 
  This project consists on creating a new package for R, it implements a new clustering method called " GBC " for " Graph Based Clustering " method. 

  The GBC method has been proposed in 2009 by the respective both IT Professors and researchers, Fabrice MUHLENBACH, Lecturer in Computer Science, Research Professor at the Hubert Curien laboratory, UMR CNRS 5516, at Jean Monnet University of Saint-Étienne, France; and Stéphane LALLICH, Emeritus Professor at Lyon 2 University, Research Professor at the ERIC Laboratory (EA 3083), at University Lumière Lyon 2, France.

  This method (GBC) detects automatically the optimal number of “K” clusters of a dataset and performs the appropriate clustering without requiring any other clustering parameter. It comes as a solution to the problem encountered in most of the Machine Learning Clustering methods (such as K-means, DBSCAN, Ward’s Hierarchical algorithm, etc.) in which is very often necessary to define a certain number of parameters beforehand to determine the ideal number of clusters K to perform the final clustering, which is not always an easy task; as it is the case for example with the K-means method, the user have to determine the number of clusters K in advanced to the algorithm, which can be not efficient, because in certain cases of datasets we cannot define the appropriate number of its clusters easily.
